# Master-s-Thesis


## Overview
This repository contains the research and documentation for my Master's thesis titled "Labor Market in Turkey: Empirical Investigation of Polarization". The thesis explores the evolution of employment structure in Turkey, examining supply-side and demand-side factors. It highlights the "job polarization" phenomenon in the early 2000s, emphasizing the role of technological advancement and global trade. The study utilizes Labor Force Statistics from 2004 to 2022 (TurkStat). In the initial period (2004-2012), a nearly monotonic relationship between skill level and employment growth is identified, while the second period (2012-2022) shows signs of wage polarization. Sectoral composition changes contribute to employment shifts, with wage polarization explained by occupation-specific characteristics and task measurements at both occupation and worker levels.
